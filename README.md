# kickstarter-analysis

Analyzing kickstarter data
- Three conclusions
    - May, June, and July are the most successful months for theater kickstarters.
    - There’s a seasonal increase for both successful and failed theater kickstarters that starts in April, but the increase is much sharper for those that are successful.
    - On average, the higher the goal, the higher the chance of failure.   The lower the goal, the higher the chance of success.
- Observed limitations
    - The “Outcomes Based on Goals” doesn’t have a goal category for exactly 50,000.  Instead, we have goals for just up to 49,999 and then greater than 50,000.   Because of this, we miss out on 4 failed kickstarters that had goals of 50,000 which makes the total picture a little incomplete.
- Suggested additional tables of graphs
    - Louise’s play Fever is based in the United States, so giving additional context that is specific to success/failure rates for the USA specifically and not just all countries would be helpful.
    - Adding an additional graph and tables for how the # of backers correlates with success or failure would also help Louise get closer to making a more informed decision overall.
